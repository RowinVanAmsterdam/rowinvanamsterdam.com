The question I often got asked is: "Can you name an example or a problem whether the blockchain is really usefull for?". While I can name a lot of examples, I ran into an issue recently that I think is a good example of how the blockchain can be used to solve an existing problem. 

## The current problem with digital games
Let's start with explaining the current problem. As you may already know, (digital) games are often sold on platforms like Steam, Playstation, Xbox, etc. These platforms are often used to buy and play games. The problem is that you can't resell these digital games. You can only sell your account, but as you can imagine that's not the same. It's not only illegal, but the chance of being scammed is huge. Bottom line, you can't sell your digital games to someone else after your purchase on a legal way.

Yes, some services like Steam offer you the option to receive a refund if you haven't played the game for more than 2 hours for example. But that's still not the same as reselling the game.

And while I just talked about the problem from the perspective of the user, the problem is also present from the perspective of the immediary. In this case the company behind the platform, like Sony, Microsoft or Valve. The profit of selling digital games is much higher than selling physical games, because there are less third-parties involved that are necessary to make a physical game and appears in a store (also don't forget the material costs of course). Besides, digital games is much more interesting, because physical games can be resold and the platform owner doesn't get a cut of the profit after the initial purchase. So why would they offer a service for selling digital games, right? 

## Is it really a problem or just another way of 

## The blockchain
ERC721 (a.k.a nfts ) / build for ownership.
Royalties/fees 

## Does this solution not already exist?
g2a reselling digital keys -> Gamble if key is not stolen, still working and still no option to resell after purchase


I want to say that while I think this is a good example of how the blockchain can be used to solve an existing problem, I don't think this will be implemented in the near future. The blockchain itself is still pretty new and services like this should be user friendly/easy to use for the average user. And even then the company behind the service should agree to implement this, what I highly doubt will happen if the current sales model is working well for them.

What are you thoughts about this?
